There are several types of web servers available, each designed to serve specific purposes and cater to different types of web applications. The main types of web servers are:

1. **Apache HTTP Server (Apache)**:
   - Apache is one of the most popular and widely used web servers worldwide. It's open-source and cross-platform, making it compatible with various operating systems.
   - It supports multiple programming languages such as PHP, Python, Perl, and more, making it versatile for serving dynamic content.
   - Apache provides a high level of configurability and is known for its robustness and stability.
   - However, Apache can be relatively resource-intensive compared to other web servers, which may impact performance under high load.

2. **Nginx (pronounced "engine-x")**:
   - Nginx is a lightweight and high-performance web server that has gained significant popularity in recent years.
   - It excels at serving static content, handling a large number of concurrent connections, and efficiently handling network requests.
   - Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache, making it suitable for more complex setups and high-traffic websites.
   - While Nginx can serve dynamic content through modules and FastCGI, it is generally not as feature-rich as Apache in this regard.

3. **Internet Information Services (IIS)**:
   - IIS is Microsoft's web server for Windows-based servers and is tightly integrated with Windows Server operating systems.
   - It supports ASP.NET and other Microsoft technologies, making it an ideal choice for hosting .NET web applications.
   - IIS is known for its ease of use and integration with other Microsoft products, but it is less commonly used for non-Windows environments.

4. **LiteSpeed Web Server**:
   - LiteSpeed is a commercial web server known for its high performance and efficiency.
   - It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apache, offering better performance while maintaining compatibility with Apache configurations.
   - LiteSpeed can handle more concurrent connections and serve static content efficiently, making it suitable for high-traffic websites.

5. **Caddy**:
   - Caddy is a modern web server that aims to be user-friendly and easy to configure.
   - It comes with built-in HTTPS support and automatic certificate provisioning, simplifying the process of securing websites with SSL/TLS.
   - Caddy is suitable for small to medium-sized websites and web applications with straightforward configurations.

6. **Cherokee**:
   - Cherokee is an open-source web server that offers a graphical user interface for configuration.
   - It focuses on performance, security, and flexibility and supports various technologies such as PHP, Python, and Ruby.
   - Cherokee is not as widely used as some of the other web servers but can be a good option for users who prefer a GUI-based configuration.

In terms of functionality and performance, the choice of a web server depends on the specific requirements of the web application and the expected traffic load. Factors to consider include the type of content to be served (static or dynamic), the programming languages and technologies used in the application, the server's resource utilization, and the scalability needs.

For high-performance requirements and heavy traffic websites, Nginx and LiteSpeed are often preferred due to their efficient handling of concurrent connections and static content delivery. For complex applications that require extensive module support and compatibility with various programming languages, Apache remains a popular choice.

Ultimately, the best web server for a particular project depends on its specific needs and the expertise of the development and operations team. It's common to see a combination of web servers and load balancers used in large-scale web applications to distribute the load efficiently and ensure high availability and performance.
